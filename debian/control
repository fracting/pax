Description: portable version of MirBSD paxtar (cpio, pax, tar)
 mircpio packages the MirBSD cpio(1) = pax(1) = tar(1) command,
 also known as paxtar. This is an alternative implementation of
 the POSIX archiver supporting bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and
 without CRC, old tar, and ustar, but not the format known as
 pax yet. It has extensions for removing non-numerical user and
 group IDs from the archive, setting ownership to the superuser,
 anonymising inode and device information, storing hardlinked
 files only once, and changing the mtime to zero.
